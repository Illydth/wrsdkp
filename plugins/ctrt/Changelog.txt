- Changed the way a new member gets added into the database (will now update ranks/level/class)
- Updated the lang_main.php file with new lines for updates for members

Version 1.12 (Most of the changes were made by olgren, thx)
- Modified process_parse to extract all attendees join and leave times rather than just 'first join', 'last join', and 'last leave'.
- Used the newly extracted information to more accurately determine if someone was present.
- Created a new 'filter' for 'boss kill time'. This new filter determines if an event or raid note matches a boss name. If it does the bosses kill time is used to determine if a player was present. This eliminates the problem of people joining a raid after the boss was killed but the loot hasn't been picked up yet.
- Consolidated the new 'boss kill filter', 'loot time filter' into a single entry in the config.php.
    $ctrt_set_AttendanceFilter = 2; // Sets the type of attendance filtering
    0 = None ( if a person was in the raid they are added to all events )
    1 = Loot Time ( if a person was in the raid when the loot attached to an event was picked up they are added to the event )
    2 = Boss Kill Time ( if a person was in the raid when a boss attached to an event was killed they are added to the event )
- Added a new $ctrt_set_DefaultDKPCost to the config.php. This sets the default dkp value of an item if no dkp was set when it was looted. Without this it's easy for an item to be added to the event with no dkp value in which case it's not added to the event when we 'insert raid(s)'.
- There appear to be circumstances where an attendees join and leave times are the same. If this happened the attendee's 'leave time' was never populated due to a < check. This caused the importer to think the player never left. Updated this to <= check.
- Added comments to the process_parser function.
- The left admin menu will be shown always (This require a little change in the admin/index.php, see "Installation" part)
- Fixed some in_array warnings
- Fixed some "Wrong datatype for second argument" Warnigns
